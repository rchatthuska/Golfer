:heavy_check_mark:  A program for managing golfer information using a Binary Search Tree.

## How to Run
1. Download BTNode.java, Golfer. jave, GolferScoresTree.java, TreeBag.java
2. Run GloferScoresTree.java

# Overview
Your program will start by reading an input file containing golfer information. Each line in this file provides the necessary details to create a Golfer object. This file will be provided to you.

As each line is read, a Golfer object is created and placed into a Binary Search Tree (BST) sorted by the golfers' last names (not by their scores). After processing the file, a menu is displayed with options to display golfer information, update, remove, or add new golfers.

When the user chooses to quit, the contents of the BST are traversed and written back to update the original data file. This allows the updated data to be reused in subsequent runs of the program. For testing purposes, it is recommended to use a differently named file to avoid corrupting the original data during debugging.
